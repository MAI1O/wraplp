# Wrap LP

Deposit any ERC20 token into the WRAP LP contract and get an NFT (ERC721) representation of the ERC20 tokens you deposited, you can use this as proof of "liquidity" to get yield from multiple apps at the same time.

Note that DuckChef.sol was not tested yet and it's a proof of concept until https://nft20.io launch on Jan 15th.
